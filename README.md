This repository demonstrates a common issue with the catch-all route (`*`) in React Router v6. The problem is that the catch-all route is not working as expected and not catching routes that are not explicitly defined.  This can lead to unexpected behavior or errors when navigating to undefined routes.

The solution demonstrates a corrected implementation that resolves the problem.
